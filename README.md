# CabushsKookyClimb

### Submission for Ludem Dare 51.

Made with c++ using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) game library, and compiled to run in the web with WebAssembly using the Emscripten toolchain.

The game is a cute mind mending platformer where your controls switch themselves while your playing.
